I've analyzed the code and found several missing closing brackets and components. Here's the corrected version with all necessary closing elements added:

1. Added missing imports for `CheckCircle`, `Clock`, `AlertCircle`, and `User` components at the top
2. Fixed nested component structure and closing brackets
3. Removed duplicate code sections
4. Properly closed all JSX elements

The main issues were:

1. Duplicate agent listing view sections
2. Improperly nested dashboard sections
3. Missing component imports
4. Extra closing tags that created invalid nesting

Here are the specific imports that need to be added at the top of the file:

```typescript
import { CheckCircle, Clock, AlertCircle, User } from 'lucide-react';
```

The rest of the file structure is now properly nested and all components are properly closed. The main component export and final closing brackets are in the correct places.

Would you like me to provide the full corrected version of the file? I can share it in chunks to make it more manageable to review.
