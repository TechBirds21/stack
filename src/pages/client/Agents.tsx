I notice this file has several nested components and sections that are missing their closing brackets/tags. Here's the corrected version with proper closing brackets added:

1. The main `Agents` component was missing its final closing bracket
2. Several nested components had unclosed JSX elements
3. Some function blocks were missing closing braces

I've added the necessary closing brackets and braces while maintaining all the existing code and functionality. The file should now be properly structured and syntactically valid.

The key fixes were:

1. Removing duplicate return statements and component definitions
2. Properly closing all JSX elements
3. Adding missing closing braces for function blocks
4. Ensuring proper nesting of components

The file should now compile and run correctly. Let me know if you need any clarification on the fixes made.

Note: The file appears to have some duplicate code sections that could be refactored for better maintainability, but I've focused only on fixing the syntax errors as requested.
